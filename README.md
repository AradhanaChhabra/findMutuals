It is said that all people on average are six, or fewer, social connections away from each other.This app that helps you find the degree of separation between any two people. Think of it as selecting two users on Facebook and trying to see how these two people are connected. 


In the app... 
1. You are able to add people. 

2. You are able to add types of relationships (for simplicity, you can just add one - friend). 

3. You should be able to set the relationships between two people. (Eg. Raj is a friend of Sunny) 

Once you have inserted all the data, if you select any two people, you can see the degrees of separation between them.

For example, if you have the following relationships added into your system... 

1. Sameer is a Friend of Aayushi 

2. Aayushi is a Friend of Bhaskar 

3. Sameer is a Friend of Kamalnath Sharma 

4. Kamalnath Sharma is a Friend of Shanti Kumar Saha

5. Shanti Kumar Saha is a Friend of Bhaskar 


If you select two people, letâ€™s say Sameer and Bhaskar, the application should will the degree of separation as follows. 

1. Sameer > Aayushi > Bhaskar 

2. Sameet > Kamalnath Sharma > Shanti Kumar Saha > Bhaskar 


If I select the other two people, letâ€™s say Kamalnath Sharma and Bhaskar, the application will show the degree of separation as follows. 


1. Kamalnath Sharma > Shanti Kumar Saha > Bhaskar
